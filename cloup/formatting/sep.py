"""
This module contains anything related to separators. Currently, it contains an
implementation of "row sep policies", e.g. components that decide if and how to
add an extra separator/spacing between the rows of a definition list (only for
tabular layout). In the future, it may be expanded with something analogous for
help sections.

    In practice, the row separator should be the same for all definition lists

    exists, you probably want to use that.

    Nonetheless, this protocol exists mainly for one reason: it leaves open the
    door to policies that can decide a row separator for each individual row
    (feature I'm personally against to for now), without breaking changes.
    This would make possible to implement the old Click 7.2 behavior, which
    inserted an empty line only after options with a long help. Adding this
    feature would be possible without breaking changes, by extending the return

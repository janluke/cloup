Cloup (= **Cl**\ick + gr\ **oup**\s) contains a set of
`Click <https://github.com/pallets/click>`_ extensions that enable you to:

- define **option groups** with a clean API;

- define **constraints**, including *conditional constraints*, on any group of
  parameters (e.g. ``mutually_exclusive``, ``RequireAtLeast(1)`` etc.);

- (optionally) show an auto-generated description of defined constraints in the
  command help;

- organize the subcommands of a ``MultiCommand`` in multiple **help sections**.

These features are implemented in three **mixins** following the same pattern of
click-contrib extensions. For ease of use, Cloup also provides:

- its own versions of Click commands, obtained by mixing Click classes with the
  mixins mentioned above;
- its own versions of Click decorators, for creating such commands.
